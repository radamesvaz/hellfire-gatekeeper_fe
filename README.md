## How to Open and Test

### Method 1: Direct File Opening
1. Simply double-click on `index.html` to open it in your default web browser
2. The application will load immediately with all functionality working

### Method 2: Using a Local Server (Recommended)
For the best experience, especially when testing localStorage functionality:

1. **Using Python (if installed):**
   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Python 2
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
   ```

2. **Using Node.js (if installed):**
   ```bash
   npx http-server
   ```

3. **Using Live Server (VS Code extension):**
   - Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
   - Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"

4. Then open your browser and navigate to:
   - `http://localhost:8000` (for Python/Node.js)
   - Or the URL provided by Live Server

## Testing the Cart Functionality

1. **Add Items to Cart:**
   - On the main page, click "Add to Cart" on any product
   - You'll see a notification and the cart count will update
   - Add multiple items or the same item multiple times

2. **View Cart:**
   - Click the "Cart" link in the header
   - You'll see all items you've added with quantities and totals

3. **Modify Cart:**
   - Use the "+" and "-" buttons to adjust quantities
   - Click the "√ó" button to remove items completely
   - Watch the totals update automatically

4. **Checkout:**
   - Click "Proceed to Checkout" to complete your order
   - The cart will be cleared after checkout

5. **Persistence:**
   - Close the browser and reopen the application
   - Your cart items will still be there (thanks to localStorage)
